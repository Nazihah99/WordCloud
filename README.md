# WordCloud: The Comparison of Songs Theme
## Description
This project focuses on generating WordCloud visualizations for selected song lyrics. The goal is to analyze the frequency and importance of words in the lyrics and visually represent them using WordClouds. The three chosen songs for this project are "Thank You, Next" by Ariana Grande, "Believer" by Imagine Dragons, and "Stronger (What Doesn't Kill You)" by Kelly Clarkson.

## Motivation
The introduction of legal music streaming services like Spotify, which allow offline listening, has significantly impacted the music industry. These services have gradually increased the incomes of musicians and inspired them to write more successful songs, especially when listeners can connect with the music on a deeper level. Lyrical subjects play a crucial role in how music is sung and provide insights into the songwriter's state of mind from Tunedly on Popular Lyrical Themes Used in Songwriting.

## Themes
